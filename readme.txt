A fast, GDPR-compliant newsletter plugin. Collect newsletter subscribers, let users subscribe to new post notifications, and send newsletters. ★★★★★

== Description ==

**Noptin is a fast, lightweight newsletter and email marketing plugin for WordPress.**
★★★★★<br>

It helps you collect subscribers, grow your newsletter audience, and send newsletters and notifications directly from your website, without relying on expensive third-party email services.

Noptin is designed for performance, privacy, and simplicity. It runs entirely on your own WordPress site, is GDPR-friendly by default, and does not limit the number of subscribers you can collect.

With Noptin, users can subscribe to your newsletter using subscription forms, popups, widgets, or checkout forms. You can then send them email newsletters, automatic new post notifications, and keep subscribers engaged.

Noptin works with WooCommerce out of the box to help you automate your WooCommerce powered store. It is also multisite compatible.

= Collect subscribers and grow your newsletter =

Noptin helps you turn visitors into subscribers by making it easy to subscribe from anywhere on your site.

You can:

- Create unlimited [newsletter subscription forms](https://noptin.com/guide/subscription-forms/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme).
- Let visitors subscribe using [shortcodes](https://noptin.com/guide/subscription-forms/newsletter-subscription-shortcode/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme) or [blocks](https://noptin.com/guide/subscription-forms/newsletter-subscription-block/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme).
- Show newsletter forms in a [popup or lightbox](https://noptin.com/guide/subscription-forms/pop-up-forms/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme).
- Add unlimited [newsletter subscription widgets](https://noptin.com/guide/subscription-forms/newsletter-subscription-widget/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme) to sidebars, footers, and other widget areas.
- Collect and manage unlimited [email subscribers](https://noptin.com/guide/email-subscribers/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme).
- [Tag and segment](https://noptin.com/guide/email-subscribers/tagging-subscribers/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme) email subscribers for targeted newsletters.
- Store subscribers securely inside WordPress.

All subscribers are managed directly in your WordPress dashboard, though you can use an addon to connect an external email service such as Mailchimp and send subscribers there.

= Send newsletters and notifications from WordPress =

Once users subscribe, you can send them newsletters, SMS notifications, Slack or telegram messages, automated emails and new post notifications.

With Noptin, you can send:

- [Latest Posts](https://noptin.com/guide/sending-emails/post-digest-emails-wordpress/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme) - Automatically send a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly email highlighting your latest posts.
- [New Post Notification](https://noptin.com/guide/sending-emails/new-post-notifications/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme) - Automatically notify your subscribers, users, or customers everytime you publish new content on your site.
- Automatically send your subscribers, users, or customers an email every X days.
- Welcome emails or SMS to new [subscribers](https://noptin.com/guide/sending-emails/welcome-emails/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme), [WooCommerce customers](https://noptin.com/guide/sending-emails/automatically-send-email-new-woocommerce-customers/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme), or [WordPress users](https://noptin.com/guide/sending-emails/welcome-users/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme).
- Newsletters to [ email subscribers](https://noptin.com/guide/sending-emails/newsletter-subscribers/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme), [WordPress users](https://noptin.com/guide/sending-emails/wordpress-users/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme), or [WooCommerce customers](https://noptin.com/guide/sending-emails/woocommerce-customers/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme).
- Automatically [notify your subscribers everytime you publish a new blog post](https://noptin.com/guide/sending-emails/new-post-notifications/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme) so that they can keep coming back to your website.
- An email, SMS, or telegram message when a WooCommerce cart is abandoned.
- Unique next order coupon codes or thank you emails.
- Send notifications to slack when you get a new subscribers, WooCommerce order, etc.

The best part is that you are able to do all this without leaving your WordPress dashboard. If you are worried about email deliverability, you can install any SMTP plugin of your choice and Noptin will automatically use it to send your newsletters. No configuration needed!

= Automated newsletter notifications =

Noptin makes it easy to send email notifications to subscribers whenever you publish new content.

Each time you publish a post, Noptin can automatically notify subscribers by email. These notifications help bring subscribers back to your website and increase repeat traffic.

You can control which subscribers receive notifications using categories, tags, custom fields, or automation rules.

= Getting Email Subscribers =

If you're migrating from another newsletter service or plugin, start by [importing your existing newsletter subscribers into Noptin](https://noptin.com/guide/getting-email-subscribers/importing-subscribers/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme).

To collect new subscribers, you can let users subscribe by adding a newsletter subscription checkbox to your:

- [WordPress user registration forms](https://noptin.com/guide/getting-email-subscribers/wordpress-registration-forms/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme), including default WordPress, WooCommerce, BuddyPress, UsersWP, and Ultimate Member registration forms.
- [WordPress comment forms](https://noptin.com/guide/getting-email-subscribers/wordpress-comment-forms/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme).
- [WooCommerce checkout pages](https://noptin.com/guide/getting-email-subscribers/woocommerce-checkout/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme).
- [EDD checkout pages](https://noptin.com/guide/getting-email-subscribers/edd-checkout/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme).
- Contact forms created by [Ninja Forms](https://noptin.com/guide/getting-email-subscribers/ninja-forms/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme), [Gravity Forms](https://noptin.com/guide/getting-email-subscribers/gravity-forms/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme), [Elementor](https://noptin.com/guide/getting-email-subscribers/elementor-forms/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme), [WPForms](https://noptin.com/guide/getting-email-subscribers/wpforms/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme), [Contact Form 7](https://noptin.com/guide/getting-email-subscribers/contact-form-7/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme), etc.

= Built for speed and scalability =

Noptin is optimized to handle thousands of subscribers without slowing down your website.

It does not load heavy external scripts and is designed to scale as your newsletter and subscriber list grows.

It's built by marketers. As a result, we put most of our focus on optimizing for speed and the conversion rate. We offer several conversion rate optimization techniques out of the box.

**For example**, you can easily offer content upgrades and lead magnets with your email opt-in forms to gain more newsletter subscribers.

= Increase your website traffic =

Studies suggest that repeat website visitors are more likely to convert than first-time visitors. That is why Noptin makes it easy to notify your email subscribers every time you publish a new blog post.

This increases your website traffic as your newsletter subscribers login to read your new content.

Let users sign up for your newsletter using any of the following email opt-in form types:-

= Seamless Integrations =
