= Collect unlimited email subscribers =

Noptin is **so fast** and can scale to thousands of subscribers without hurting your servers.

It's built by marketers. As a result, we put most of our focus on optimizing for speed and the conversion rate. We offer several conversion rate optimization techniques out of the box.

**For example**, you can easily offer content upgrades and lead magnets with your email optin forms to gain more newsletter subscribers.

= Increase your website traffic =

Studies suggest that repeat website visitors are more likely to convert than first-time visitors. That is why Noptin makes it easy to notify your email subscribers every time you publish a new blog post.

This increases your website traffic as your newsletter subscribers login to read your new content.

Let users sign up for your newsletter using any of the following email opt-in form types:-

= Popup Email Opt-in Forms =

These are shown in a popup or lightbox overlay and have a very high conversion rate. You can easily create an email popup form and attach one of our trigger options.

**For example**, you can display the newsletter optin form when the user is about to leave your website or a few seconds after they open a specific page.

= Embedded Email Opt-in Forms =

Noptin allows you to embed an email opt-in form inside any post, page or custom post type. You can quickly create a form using our newsletter block or create one using our <a href="https://noptin.com/guide/opt-in-forms-editor/" target="_blank">Opt-in Forms Editor</a> and embed it in your content using a shortcode.

= Email Opt-in Widgets =

Noptin ships with two newsletter optin widgets.

= Content Upgrades =

Noptin makes it easy to add content upgrades to your newsletter optin forms. You set the URL to your lead magnet as the redirect URL and new subscribers will be able to download your lead magnets after they subscribe.

= Automated New Post Notifications =

Increase traffic to your website by automatically emailing your newsletter subscribers every time you publish a new blog post.

= One-Time Email Newsletters =

You can also send beautiful newsletters from WordPress to all your subscribers anytime you like. There is no limit to the number of newsletter emails you can send.
